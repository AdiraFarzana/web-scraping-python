The staff were amazing in Thirty8 and JPTeres. Also  the reception people were very helpful. Jolly and her team put her full effort to find my lost nose pins  which I accidentally threw in the garbage. This was the best. In JPteres the Nepalese chef Babu  cooked us great food with my father's health requirements as well as mom's desi food. And the end he offered to make customised masala tea.

      "rev1:The only thing I would comment on is that it doesn't seem to make sense to have its reception on the 38th floor (highest floor) as there is ample space on the ground floor to have the reception there. Having the reception on the 38th means guests have to travel down by another set of lifts to their rooms  and each time a guest wants to go to the ground floor  the guest will need to take a lift to the 38th  walk to the other side and take another set of lifts to the ground floor. Inconvenient. Wastes electricity if you ask me. The 38th could be turned into another amazing F&B area. Also  the ground floor at present seems under-utilised. Feels kind of empty and cold. Not enough seats.\n",

On this trip  we were there to celebrate my wife’s birthday and made a small  simple request to have something special for breakfast. They offered to give us a cake  which was nice to begin with  but what came with it was something truly special and extraordinary. They had a one of their breakfast staff (Mr Izhar)  who i also found out had vocal training  sang us a birthday song in CLASSICAL OPERA! It was truly a birthday to remember for my wife.

I wonder how long we would've waited had we actually arrived at 3pm.4) the only reason im not letting this incident affect my rating of this hotel is that i felt they dealt with it well. I was given a room upgrade  a drink at the lounge while waiting and a nice touch which was an apology note and chocolates sent to the room.5) one aspect which could hv been handled better is the front desk staff who brought us down to the restaurant should hv ensured that the restaurant staff knew that the drinks were on the house. Two of the restaurant staff thought we were doing a dine and dash when we started to walk back up to reception to check on our room status. Not very pleasant to be stopped and hv this happen.\n",

I have to applaud Grand Hyatt for having the most balanced staff where they are super attentive when you need them  and are not bothersome when you don't  and most importantly  they always had a smile on their faces whenever approached. We were upgraded wholly unexpectedly despite arriving 3hrs before check-in and were in our suite within half an hour despite being told it may take an hour for the manager to check and clear the room. We hardly left the hotel because the food was amazing. Thirty8 definitely impressed and we had all three meals there  but for a light dinner or if you're in between meals  the Poolhouse was great as well. We did not manage to try JPTeres this time but we will definitely be back. I had a massage at the Essa Spa and it was the best massage i've had in a long time so kudos for that too. Great ambience  great location (across the road from my KL office)  and fantastic staff. 5* hotels are usually pretty standard when it comes to amenities and it is the staff that make or break a trip for us.

Although at first it seemed that the hotel management was worried about what happened  later came out that they first thought about their reputation. We had already checked out of the hotel and spent some time at the hotel pool as my wife's health deteriorated. After a couple of hours  he started to vomit and asked the hotel again for a room we had to pay for  of course. His health went worse and we were forced to go to the hospital. We came back from the hospital only the next day. I met the hotel manager again and explained to him the situation. My wife was not able to travel and we were left behind from her flights and seemed to have to stay in Kuala Lumpur for the new years eve. This meant that we should have canceled all of our plans that we had with our family in the New Year's Eve at home . I asked if the hotel was ready to compensate somehow our suffering caused by food poisoning and to accommodate us for two nights so we could return home on 2 January. After it was clear that the hotel didn't feel responsible for what happened  and although my wife felt very weak  we decided to leave Kuala Lumpur and still get home by the New Year's Eve. I asked the hotel administrator to arrange an airport transfer and they asked for 130 euros.Hotel rooms have very thin walls so you can hear all your neighbours and movements in corridor.

      "rev1:The beds were not comfortable  nor were the pillows. The first room they gave us was supposed to have a king-size bed. However  while the bed was indeed large  it was not until we were ready to sleep  that I discovered that the bed had 2 twin-size mattresses on top. Very uncomfortable to have a ridge in the middle of the bed! In addition  the matresses were quite hard and the pillows were too soft. It was already quite late  so we decided to sleep on this bed and the next day we would ask for a change. The next morning I went to the front desk and asked for a change of room. They said a room should be available around 12:00 noon. When I approached the front desk around 13:00 o'clock  they said the room was not yet ready because it was being cleaned. They said they would notify me when the room is available. We went out and when we returned around 15:00 o'clock  I asked the front desk whether the room is ready. They said not yet  that it was still being cleaned  but that it will be about 10 minutes and that they will call me when it is ready. So  we waited in our room. When 40 minutes later there was no call  I started toward the front desk. Then they called the room  but I did not get to the phone quickly enough. I called right back  but no answer. After several more unsuccessful calls to the front desk  I finally got a response - they said they are still getting the room ready and will call me when ready. So  we were stuck in the room waiting for them to finish preparing the new room. Finally  about 17:30  they called us to tell us the new room was ready. The bed in the new room was not with twin mattresses... it had a regular king size mattress. But the mattress was still hard and the pillows still very soft. Another item - the bathtub was quite small. The amenities were good  but not up to the standards of a highly-rated 5-star hotel. There was no mouthwash - a minor item  but expected from a highly rated hotel.\n",

I cut my trip 3 days short as a result of the service at this hotel and the staff treatment. Concierge is absolutely useless and clueless about things to do/restaurants. They are unprofessional too. Told the concierge to book me a dinner nearby at 10pm and when I went the restaurant was closing down. I walked back to the hotel and told him Sir could you please do your research right before sending me off to places? Can you at least know what time they close??! Also  I asked if theres a zoo I could visit and guess what Concierge replied to me? “You need to take a 3 hour flight to go to the zoo”. I had a spa treatment at the hotel spa one day and I casually asked my “very nice therapist by the way -she was literally the only professional person on the premises  her name was Rita” so Rita tells me theres a zoo 30 mins away from the hotel. !!!! I was appalled! I kept asking where the hotel manager was so I could report my complaints and remarks directly to him but I came to know he wasn’t around. I did get his name however. Mr Robert. If you’re reading this  please  please do something about the staff manners. I hated the entire country because of my experience and I cut my trip short  please look back at my booking details to confirm this information. One more thing to add is housekeeping services is so slow. I ask for a fresh set of towels and receive it 1 hour after I make the request. Bare in mind according to the front desk  200 rooms were vacant at the time I was there as there was a  convention going on and had ended the day I checked in -hence no excuse for such lags and unprofessionalism. It wasn’t even full house! So upset and disappointed by the entire hotel chain. How crazy is it for service to leave such a horrible impact \n",

The hotel is in a fantastic location - easy to walk to Bukit Bintang and the eco-park  which are great fun. The hotel also screams luxury from the moment you walk in the door - I think it is the best hotel that I have ever stayed in.\n",

      "rev2:One of the best hotels I've ever stayed in KL  period! The number one thing you should notice is the staff's greetings  hospitality and their readiness to help you in anyway to make your stay as comfortable as can be. The lobby surroundings was one of the wow factor because the lobby is not exactly at the lobby level we usually used to. It's actually situated at the top of the building  39th floor! And it faces the KLCC building. So imagine you're up there with the view while doing the check-in. It's magnificent! The room was way more comfortable than I anticipated and all the amenities that comes with it are quite well equipped. They have thought of everything to the last detail in their rooms. The view was spectacular and I love their bathroom  state-of-the-art bathroom glass window! (you'll know when the bellboy show you what it can do) And they have a small changing room in the bathroom section to put your luggages  so that the bags won't occupy the spaces around your bed area. The room that we booked was the standard deluxe twin type and it already blew my mind  so I can't imagine how their other bigger rooms will be like. Their breakfast is one of the best I've ever consumed  hands down. Their continental breakfast is really top of the line  along with their bread and pastries. Not to mention they have the Malaysian food and Asian breakfast included too like dim sum  yong chow fried rice  nasi lemak  mee hoon  capati  dhal  roti canai  chicken rendang at their marvelous restaurant called Thirty Eight  simply because it's at level 38. Haha. The view is pretty spectacular to begin with  so be sure to wake up early to catch the sunrise around KL buildings as you enjoy your breakfast and taking pictures too. Overall  my experience at this hotel is quite enjoyable and overwhelming I have to say. I've stayed at several hotels in KL before but this hotel is just another level of wonderful ambience and luminous class.\n",

      "rev1:Having sciatic injury  would have expected a comfortable mattress. Since we planned to stay in more due to the occassion and purpose of visit  TV channels could have been better. Also  it may be a good time to relocate the check in area as going up and down the hotel is too much of a hassle. I just checked myself in at the Mandarin Oriental for my birthday and had the best time of my life - complimentary late check out at 3pm  email reminder that I have left an item at the hotel  the mattress were top notch for my back and the room was just wonderful that i felt guilty in paying lesser than what MO truly deserved. I had made prior bookings at MO and they have never failed to impress with each visit. I chose to check in at Grand Hyatt for my anniversary  thinking that it could at least match my expectation and my feelings just dropped upon check in. Due to not having cash in hand for the deposit  informed them to just charge my card for the whole stay amount and will swing by the reception for the RM300 deposit  i was placed on time limit by the hotel and was told that they will call me if i did not make the payment for the small deposit by 7pm. Having a preference in my method of deposit  i had no issues with all the top hotel chains in the past with this deposit issue since i will always ask the hotel to charge the full price of stay upon check in. No receipt was given at all for the deposit as well as for my room rate. Was advised upon check out that the hotel would email the receipt but no updates to date. When we ordered in for a late dinner during our last night as we decided to try the hotel’s food  we were told that the instruction given to the staff was for me to pay immediately with cash  even though the food price was much lesser than the deposit that had been paid. So much hassle that I wished i did not change my first choice of hotel in KL  the Mandarin Oriental that has never disappoint me during my stay. Thank you for your hospitality.\n",

      "rev2:We stayed in Grand Hyatt Kuala Lumpur for one night after returning from our vacation in Bali and continuing our journey back to Geneva. Hotel is well situated in the central area of Kuala Lumpur and is approximately four minute walk away from Petronas Towers. Hotel is well connected with Suria KLCC as there is an underground path that will take you directly to the mall that has a great variety of high-end shops. We stayed in a Grand Deluxe King room that had a wonderful view to the KLCC Park and the high-rise buildings of Kuala Lumpur. It was very spacious and cosy. Furthermore  we really enjoyed the design of the bathroom that was split into two spacious parts. Separately I would like to highlight the professional attitude and courtesy of Grégoire who assisted us during our stay. He well advised us on the places we should visit in Kuala Lumpur as well as assisted by walking us to the underground path that was connected with Suria KLCC. Thank you for your professional work Grégoire and the rest of Grand Hyatt Team. Nevertheless to mention we had a check-out at 12:00 and as our flight was late in the evening  we were kindly allowed to use the hotel facilities and spent the whole day at the swimming pool that had a great view to Petronas Towers and was well maintained. And as the last thing to mention is breakfast that was super delicious. There was a great choice of different cuisines and the view from the restaurant is spectacular. This was definitely the most exciting thing from our stay at the Grand Hyatt Kuala Lumpur.\n",

We have stayed at many 5 star hotels and was disappointed with the service at Hyatt. We arrived after 4pm and was told to wait for our room. We were not offered any refreshments but had to ask for it and was told to go to the Ground floor. We had a long day and were too tired to go all the way down from the lobby which was at level 39. When I asked what is the reason for the delay the front office mentioned that they have many guests and instead gave us another room which was a suite. The suite was provided as a matter of fact and I asked for a room facing the twin towers as that was what we booked. Apparently the room we booked was not available and they had no choice but to give us the suite. Since we were tired I asked if we can wait at the executive lounge but the front office manager answered non chalantly \"you are not entitled to the lounge access\"!  During breakfast we requested for a table with twin tower view and was yet again told that there is none. lo and behold we saw there were a few tables but was too tired to ask the lady why she said there was none. we were given \"complimentary biscuits\" in a jar due to the delay in check and when we were checking out and waiting for our car we were stopped by your manager asking us if we took the biscuits jar and asked us to return the same!\n",
