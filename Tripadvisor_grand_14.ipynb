We could actualy watch the ugly side of the Mandarin tho but that only happens if we look down. ;-) The glas-bath area is pretty funky - also facing the KLs Skyline icl. the Petronas.

      "review:I used to stay at the Ritz Carlton and Marriot prior to Grand Hyatt opening up.  Upon arrival I was blown away with the spectacular view when checking in.  It reminded me of Park Hyatt in Tokyo.  Check in was prompt (less than 5mins).  Two favourite items about this hotel: first were the rooms.  Not only was the room plush  slick and modern but I loved the layout where you can actually walk inside a tiny corridor behind the bedroom where the restroom bathrooms and showers are located.  Next  the restaurant on top called 38 restaurant and lounge is fabulous.  You can either go there for dinner or opt for listening to live jazz over drinks.  The buzz and energy coupled with a towering ceiling with views of the Petronas Towers is enough to justify a night at this lovely hotel.  We chose dinner with surprisingly decent prices for wine (given its a hotel restaurant) and stayed back to have a few drinks at the bar later.  The friendly barman threw in a few extra cocktails he was experimenting with and sadly  I couldn't remember the rest of the night.  Hands down  best hotel in KL.\n",

      "review:Stunning! We reached the hotel front door via taxi and was promptly attended to by their staffs. Our luggage was handed by the bell boy and we were guided to the lift by the supervisor. The lift has two button- lobby and ground floor. The elevator shot up to the top floor and the door opened to a stunning top of the world 360 degree panoramic view of Kuala Lumpur skyline through its  top to bottom glass wall extending from the high ceiling all the way down to a floor below. We walked around the perimeter of the top floor enjoying the geography of kuala lumpur. We were greeted by the receptionist who were amicable and guided us to the lifts which are dedicated to the guest rooms. Our room is huge at 500 sqf. Roughly one third of the room is dedicated to form a small walk in closet  a separate toilet  a vanity space  a space for the designer sink with mirror and lastly a huge bathroom with rain shower  shower head and a stand alone bathtub. A partition glass between the bathroom and the bedroom can be altered opaque by a switch furnishing privacy. Huge round designer sofa and an extremely comfortable king size bed render leaving the room a chore. Ceiling to floor glass window gives us a clear unobstructed view while all surround sound system  emitting high quality audio output from the television from every corner of the room  put the finishing touch into a perfect hotel room.The hotel is right next to KLCC Mall and linked via an elevated walkway directly to Pavilion mall and Jalan Bukit Bintang. There is no perfect trip to Kuala Lumpur without staying in this hotel. Believe me.\n",

Admittedly in a stay longer than a day or two having to go via the 39th floor of the building will become a hassle  but on arrival it is impressive.The hotel breakfast is worth getting included in the room rate  with sweeping views from the Level 38 restaurant. Otherwise the restaurant is pricey  but very nice and with some reasonably priced options.The hotel pool is great. Recommended after a long day in the tropical heat. Whilst the hotel was busy  the pool was quiet and relaxed the whole time and a nice place for a quiet drink away from the Level 38 bar.The rooms were superb  touches of quality throughout. I would recommend getting pillows of your choosing from the hotel reception as the standard pillows are not for everyone.A tower view is nice if you can spring for it  but a stay longer than 2 days and you will have seen the Petronas Towers so much you may loose interest.Great works spaces throughout for business and professionals. \n",

There was a young man in the Grand Club  I believe his name was Didi who mixed great drinks and always with a smile (haven't seen him in a while) but in general the staff is great.The view -- ah  stunning views of the Petronas towers.The restaurant -- great steaks and fantastic food.Stayed with my wife about 10 days ago  and she was taken care of perfectly as well. Great  great hotel.\n",
